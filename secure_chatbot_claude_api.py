    🛡️ SECURITY SCANNER FUNCTION - THE GUARDIAN OF YOUR CHATBOT
    
    WHAT THIS FUNCTION DOES:
    Think of this function as a security guard that examines every message before
    it reaches the AI. Just like airport security checks your luggage, this function
    checks your text messages for any dangerous or inappropriate content.

    HOW IT PROTECTS YOU:
    1. 🔍 SCANS every word and phrase in your message
    2. 🚨 DETECTS various types of threats and harmful content
    3. ✅ APPROVES safe messages to continue to the AI
    4. 🚫 BLOCKS dangerous messages before they cause problems

    TYPES OF THREATS IT CATCHES:
    - 💳 Personal Information: Credit cards, social security numbers, passwords
    - 🎭 Manipulation Attempts: Tricks trying to make the AI misbehave  
    - 🔗 Dangerous Links: Suspicious websites that could be harmful
    - 🤬 Toxic Content: Hate speech, harassment, inappropriate material
    - 💻 Malicious Code: Attempts to inject harmful computer instructions

    WHAT YOU NEED TO PROVIDE:
    - prompt: The message you want to check (like "Hello, how are you?")
    - api_key: Your secret password to access Palo Alto's security service
    - ai_profile_name: The name of your security ruleset/configuration
    - base_url: The web address of Palo Alto's security servers

    WHAT YOU GET BACK:
    - A detailed report telling you if the message is safe or dangerous
    - Specific information about any threats found
    - A recommendation to either "allow" or "block" the message

    # 🌐 STEP 1: BUILD THE SECURITY API CONNECTION

    # It's like writing the address on an envelope before mailing it.

    # ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
    # 🏷️ STEP 2: CREATE A TRACKING NUMBER FOR THIS SECURITY SCAN
    # ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
    # Every security scan gets a unique ID number, like a tracking number for a package.
    # This helps Palo Alto's servers keep track of your specific security request.
    # If something goes wrong, support can use this ID to find exactly what happened.

    # 📋 STEP 3: PREPARE THE SECURITY REQUEST HEADERS

    # They tell Palo Alto's security servers how to handle our request.

    # ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

    # It contains your message plus information about what security rules to apply.

    🚀 MAIN CHATBOT CONTROLLER - THE BRAIN OF THE OPERATION
    
    WHAT THIS FUNCTION DOES (STEP BY STEP):
    Think of this as the "control center" that manages everything the chatbot does.
    It's like the conductor of an orchestra, making sure every part plays at the right time.

    THE COMPLETE WORKFLOW:
    1. 🔑 SETUP PHASE: Checks that you have all the required passwords and settings
       - Verifies your Palo Alto Networks security credentials
       - Verifies your Claude AI credentials  
       - Makes sure everything is properly configured

    2. 🧠 INITIALIZATION PHASE: Starts up all the necessary services
       - Connects to Palo Alto's security scanning service
       - Connects to Claude AI service
       - Prepares everything for chatting

    3. 💬 CHAT LOOP PHASE: Handles the actual conversation
       - Waits for you to type a message
       - Sends your message through security screening first
       - If safe: forwards to Claude AI for a smart response
       - If dangerous: blocks the message and warns you

    🛡️ SECURITY-FIRST ARCHITECTURE:
    This chatbot follows a "guilty until proven innocent" approach:
    - EVERY message goes through security scanning first (no exceptions!)
    - Dangerous messages are immediately blocked (better safe than sorry!)  
    - Only verified-safe messages get processed by Claude AI
    - No chat history is saved (keeps things private and secure)
    
    WHY THIS APPROACH MATTERS:
    - Prevents malicious users from tricking the AI into harmful behavior
    - Protects against data leaks and privacy violations  
    - Ensures the AI only responds to appropriate, safe requests
    - Maintains a clean, professional interaction environment
